    True. Binary search, in contrast, makes O(log2n) comparisons in the worst case.
   
2. Given an unsorted singly-linked list L of n items, which one of the following statements is False. Note that a singly-linked list is a linked list in which each node contains a single pointer to the next node in sequence.
     
     Insertion and deletion of an item I are both O(1) operations (worst case).
